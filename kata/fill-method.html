    /*The expression Array(25).fill('20p') in JavaScript creates an array with 25 elements, where every element is filled with the value '20p'. Here's what this expression does in detail:

    Array(25): This creates a new array with 25 empty (uninitialized) slots. This array will have a length of 25 but initially contains undefined for each slot.
   .fill('20p'): The fill method takes a single value and populates each slot in the array with that value. In this case, it fills all 25 slots with the string '20p'.*/
