/*Description:
Your task is to write a function that takes two integers n, m and returns a sorted array of all integers from n to m inclusive, which have only 3 divisors (1 and the number itself excluded).

Example:
solution(2, 20) -> [16]
16 has 3 divisors: 2, 4, 8 (1 and 16 aren't included)

Input:
n - integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^10)
m - integer (20 ≤ m ≤ 10^18)
NOTE: In Rust, the bounds are (2 ≤ n ≤ 2^51), (20 ≤ m ≤ 2^52).

Output:
result - array of integers*/
