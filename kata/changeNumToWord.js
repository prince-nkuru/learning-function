/*DESCRIPTION:
Wouldn't it be cool to be able to spell your numbers verbally, in digit-by-digit fashion? Instead of boring 731 you could write fancy Num.seven.three.one!

Implement a class that allows chaining methods zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine to construct numbers in a similar manner.

Note: your class should also support a method which converts its instances into integers (provided in the initial solution).*/
