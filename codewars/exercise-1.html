      /*2  My friend John and I are members of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)". John is worried because each month a list with the weights of members is published and each month he is the last on the list which means he is the heaviest.

      I am the one who establishes the list so I told him: "Don't worry any more, I will modify the order of the list". It was decided to attribute a "weight" to numbers. The weight of a number will be from now on the sum of its digits.

      For example 99 will have "weight" 18, 100 will have "weight" 1 so in the list 100 will come before 99.

      Given a string with the weights of FFC members in normal order can you give this string ordered by "weights" of these numbers?

      Example:
      "56 65 74 100 99 68 86 180 90" ordered by numbers weights becomes: 

      "100 180 90 56 65 74 68 86 99"
      When two numbers have the same "weight", let us class them as if they were strings (alphabetical ordering) and not numbers:

      180 is before 90 since, having the same "weight" (9), it comes before as a string.

     All numbers in the list are positive numbers and the list can be empty.

     Notes

*/

      function calculateWeight(num) {
     return num.split('').reduce((sum, digit) => sum + parseInt(digit), 0);
    }

   // Main function to sort the weights
   function orderWeight(strng) {
   if (!strng.trim()) {
    return ""; // Handle empty or blank string case
   }

   const numbers = strng.trim().split(' ');

   // Custom sorting by weight and then alphabetically as strings for ties
    const sortedNumbers = numbers.sort((a, b) => {
    const weightA = calculateWeight(a);
    const weightB = calculateWeight(b);

     if (weightA === weightB) {
      return a.localeCompare(b); // Alphabetical sorting if weights are the same
     }

    return weightA - weightB; // Sorting by weights
  });

  return sortedNumbers.join(' '); // Return the sorted list as a string
}

// second way 
   
function orderWeight(string) {  
  var weights = string.split(' ');

    var first = a.split('').reduce((x,y) => Number(x) + Number(y));
    var second = b.split('').reduce((x,y) => Number(x) + Number(y));
    return first - second === 0 ? a.localeCompare(b) : first - second; 
  }).join(' ');
