/*2  My friend John and I are members of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)". John is worried because each month a list with the weights of members is published and each month he is the last on the list which means he is the heaviest.

I am the one who establishes the list so I told him: "Don't worry any more, I will modify the order of the list". It was decided to attribute a "weight" to numbers. The weight of a number will be from now on the sum of its digits.

For example 99 will have "weight" 18, 100 will have "weight" 1 so in the list 100 will come before 99.

Given a string with the weights of FFC members in normal order can you give this string ordered by "weights" of these numbers?

Example:
"56 65 74 100 99 68 86 180 90" ordered by numbers weights becomes: 

"100 180 90 56 65 74 68 86 99"
When two numbers have the same "weight", let us class them as if they were strings (alphabetical ordering) and not numbers:

180 is before 90 since, having the same "weight" (9), it comes before as a string.

All numbers in the list are positive numbers and the list can be empty.

Notes

*/

function calculateWeight(num) {
return num.split('').reduce((sum, digit) => sum + parseInt(digit), 0);
}

// Main function to sort the weights
function orderWeight(strng) {
if (!strng.trim()) {
return ""; // Handle empty or blank string case
}

const numbers = strng.trim().split(' ');

// Custom sorting by weight and then alphabetically as strings for ties
const sortedNumbers = numbers.sort((a, b) => {
const weightA = calculateWeight(a);
const weightB = calculateWeight(b);

if (weightA === weightB) {
return a.localeCompare(b); // Alphabetical sorting if weights are the same
}

return weightA - weightB; // Sorting by weights
});

return sortedNumbers.join(' '); // Return the sorted list as a string
}

// second way 

function orderWeight(string) {  
var weights = string.split(' ');

return weights.sort(function(a, b) {
var first = a.split('').reduce((x,y) => Number(x) + Number(y));
var second = b.split('').reduce((x,y) => Number(x) + Number(y));
return first - second === 0 ? a.localeCompare(b) : first - second; 
}).join(' ');

/* Write a function that takes a string of braces, and determines if the order of the braces is valid. It should return true if the string is valid, and false if it's invalid.

This Kata is similar to the Valid Parentheses Kata, but introduces new characters: brackets [], and curly braces {}. Thanks to @arnedag for the idea!

All input strings will be nonempty, and will only consist of parentheses, brackets and curly braces: ()[]{}.

What is considered Valid?
A string of braces is considered valid if all braces are matched with the correct brace.

Examples
"(){}[]"   =>  True
"([{}])"   =>  True
"(}"       =>  False
"[(])"     =>  False
"[({})](]" =>  False;
}*/

while (braces.indexOf('{}') != - 1 || braces.indexOf('[]') != - 1 || braces.indexOf('()') != - 1) {
braces = braces.replace('{}', '').replace('()' ,'').replace('[]', '');
}
return braces.length == 0;
